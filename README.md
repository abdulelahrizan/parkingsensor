# parkingsensor

Welcome to Park N' Go! Our Qhacks2019-prototype thats going to revolutionize the way we park our cars! 

The platform caters to two types of users: 
People with free parking space, and people who hate having to deal with trying to find a parking spot(everyone).

Parking space hosts can purchase our sensors and set it up in their parking location and make money by renting 
out the space whenever they would like. Drivers can use the platform to find available parking spots near by.
The drivers can simply park and go on with their day. Once the car is taken out of the parking lot, the driver 
is charged:

Price = (total time parked)*(price rate)

The payment happens autonomously and the drivers would not have to involve themselves with the payment process,
allowing themselves to more time in their day not dealing with frustration.

The platform was built by using Arduino/Genuino 101 with IR break view sensors to detect if a car has parked,
a Python script that pushes Arduino serial output to Standard Library which also powers our website built on
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
